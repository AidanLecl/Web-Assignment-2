        For most people, the earth's shape is well known to be round and spherical. Some people denounce this well known fact, these people are called Flat Earthers.
        Below are some examples of points they make: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gravity does not exist, instead the differences of density are the cause of gravity's affects</li>
        <li>We can "see too far"</li>
        <li>Mass does not attract mass</li>
        <li>The earth needs some container to keep the gas on earth</li>
        <li>The sun and moon are much smaller and are much closer then on the globe model</li>
        <li>There is a dome around the earth keeping the gas in</li>
        <li>The earth does not spin</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The issue with these type of people is they are clearly spreading misinformation. Most people would consider their arguments ludicrous. Sadly most other forms of
        misinformation are not so easy to quickly dismiss. In the age of the internet, misinformation can very and easily spread through various social media platforms. It does not take much to begin down a
        rabbit hole, which may lead somewhere you never initially expected. Flat Earthers could be considered people who went too deep down various rabbit holes.
        They have went so deep that to them, arguments that attempt to disprove them are false due to the logic they use for themselves, which to others sound like nonsense.
        Flat Earthers show that when you are too deeply tied to your beliefs, it can be quite difficult to accept anything that falls outside such beliefs.
