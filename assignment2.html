      <h3>Flat Earthers And Their Misinformation</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        For most people, the earth's shape is well known to be round and spherical. Some people denounce this fact, tooth and nail if needed. These people are called Flat Earthers.
        Below are some examples of points they make: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gravity does not exist, instead the differences of density are the cause of gravity's affects</li>
        <li>We can see too far (they ignore refraction)</li>
        <li>Mass does not attract mass</li>
        <li>The earth needs some container to keep the gas on earth</li>
        <li>The sun and moon are much smaller and are much closer then what "globers" say</li>
        <li>Refraction (bending of light) does not exist</li>
        <li>Satellites don't exist</li>
        <li>There is a dome around the earth keeping the gas in</li>
        <li>The earth does not spin</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The issue with these type of people is they clearly spread misinformation. Now very few people will become Flat Earthers, since their arguments are easy to debunk, but other
        forms of misinformation are not as easy to detect. In the age of the internet, misinformation has never been so easy and fast to spread. Social media
        constantly throws information at people, and most dont properly check to make sure what they believe has evidence to back it up. It does not take much to begin down a
        rabbit hole, which may lead somewhere you never initially expected. Flat Earthers can be considered people who went too deep, who also have a really difficult time
        coming back up. Flat Earthers show that when you are too deeply tied to your beliefs, it can be quite difficult to accept anything that falls outside such beliefs.
